
each order has a strength based on how many supports it has.

claims:
  Every move on a specific province, or hold in a province.

conflicts:
  Every claims opposing a specific move _m_.
  Also, if _m_.destination has a unit _e_ which moves:
    if _e_ is moving to _m_.src, that is a conflict
    if _e_ is moving elsewhere, that is a conditional conflict, which has strength 1
      A move will have only one conditional conflict associated with it.

resolve(_m_, _lst_):
  from _m_.conflicts and _m_, winners are the set of conflicts with the highest strength
  if a winner is a conditional conflict _cc_, resolve(_cc_, _lst_ + _m_), unless _m_ is in _lst_.
    in that case, _loop_ is the list of moves after _m_ in _lst_, including _m_. resolveLoop(_loop_)
    after _cc_ is resolved, remove _cc_ from winners if _cc_ succeeded, otherwise add _cc_ as a hold with strength 1 and reassess.
  if there are multiple winners, a standoff occurs.
  if there is one winner and it is _m_, _m_.unit moves to _m_.destination
    if there is a unit in this province it is dislodged, unless that unit is co-national to the mover

resolveLoop(_lst_):
  for each of the moves _m_ of _lst_
  pretend the conditional conflicts are gone (move succeeded)
  if all moves succeed if the conditional conflicts are gone, then all moves succeed.
  Otherwise, all moves fail

cut_supports():
  for every move _m_ that isn't convoyed:
    if _m_ is moving on a unit that is supporting, and they aren't co-national
    then cut that support, unless the support is to a move that is moving on _m_
  for every move _mc_ that is convoyed:
    if _mc_ is moving on a support:
      if that support is to a move on a fleet that is __necessary__ for convoying _mc_:
        do not cut
      otherwise, conditionally cut. If the convoy is later disrupted, uncut.

disrupt_convoys():
  for every move _m_ that is on a convoying fleet:
    theoretically resolve the move. There should be no dependant conditionals, so it should resolve right away.
    if the move succeeds, the convoy is disrupted. Undo any support-cut the convoyed army did.
